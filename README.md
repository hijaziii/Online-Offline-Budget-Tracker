# Online/Offline Budget Trackers

I have generated a Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.
User will be able to track thier withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

# How To Use
 Users will enter thier transaction name and amout, then they add and/or subtract funds. A chart will be displayed to show them the curve of thier transcations.

# Technologies

  - mongoDB
  - expressJs
  - mongoose
  - manifest
